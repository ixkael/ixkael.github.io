A few colleagues and I were organising a workshop in UCL last week, entitled ‘Cross-correlations in the high-z sky’.

[xcorr2014.co.uk](http://xcorr2014.co.uk), in case you want to see the programme and the talks that were given. We were extremely lucky to have so many good participants and presentations, and we are very grateful to the invited speakers for their excellent lectures. I am including a few photos below (botice the nice weather and venues!). The conference dinner was taking place in the Design Museum, with a gorgeous view on London Bridge.

On behalf of the organising committee: thank you so much for making this workshop so interesting and lively!
