The Simons Foundation has started a new series of blog posts to feature the work of the Junior Fellows. For some reason this started with me.

I am extremely grateful to Ashley Yeager who conducted the interview andÂ spend a great deal of time and energy to decrypt my thoughts and write them in a way that is (hopefully) understandable by the general public!
