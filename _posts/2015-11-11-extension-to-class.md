My fork of CLASS to support arbitrary galaxy samples: bias, magnitude bias, and redshift distributions stored as Gaussian mixtures of discrete histograms. At some point I will submit a pull request to merge with the main repository ðŸ™‚

Please reference the repository and keep me in the loop if you use this code! This extension was not trivial&#8230;
