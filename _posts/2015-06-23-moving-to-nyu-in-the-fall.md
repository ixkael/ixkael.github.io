I am thrilled to announce that I will be moving to NYU in the Fall to take up a Simons Junior Research Fellowship, as publicised on [the official page of the Simons Foundation](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/simons-society-of-fellows/junior-fellows/). This was already obvious for those who follow me on Facebook and Twitter, especially given my numerous recent visits in NYU, but I thought I'd post an official message here too.

I've had an absolutely amazing time in UCL. These 4 years have deeply changed me, and I was very lucky to study and work in such a wonderful scientific and social environment. Special thanks to Hiranya for being an exceptional mentor, and to my collaborators and friends in UCL and beyond. I have learned a lot from you, about research and life in general, more than I could never hope.

But it is time to move on. Moving to NY(U) is a big step, and I am excited to join the Center for Cosmology and Particle Physics, where I hope to initiate exciting collaborations. Fortunately it will not be an abrupt move since I will be visiting UCL/London on a regular basis for personal and professional reasons. But a new chapter will start this Fall, so stay tuned!
