Our recent paper on what cosmological datasets have to say about neutrinos has been accepted for publication in Physical Review Letters, and selected as an [Editorâ€™s Suggestion](http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.113.041301)! A copy of the paper is publicly available on the [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.5950). The work is discussed in comprehensive blog posts at phys.org ([here](http://phys.org/news/2014-08-massive-neutrinos-cosmological-concordance.html) and [here](http://phys.org/news/2014-07-massive-neutrinos-standard-cosmological-concordance.html)), on the [UCL Science Blog](http://blogs.ucl.ac.uk/science/2014/08/07/do-neutrinos-have-mass-anatomy-of-a-scientific-debate/), and in a recent guest post on our group website [Early Universe @UCL](http://www.earlyuniverse.org/concordance-or-contradiction/). Below is a pretty picture that we considered for the press release but didn't use in the end. It shows typical observations of some data sets we've used in this work: galaxy clustering, CMB, X-ray and SZ clusters.
