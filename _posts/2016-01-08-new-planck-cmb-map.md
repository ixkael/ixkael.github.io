Keir Rogers' (UCL) papers about CMB foreground separation for [temperature](http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.01322) and [polarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.01417) are now available, offering to the world new clean CMB maps from the Planck data produced using directional wavelets. This is a neat piece of work, resulting from several months of enjoyable collaborative work. The papers are products are available at [silc-cmb.org](http://www.silc-cmb.org/). Note that the maps can be cited via Zenodo!
