Hi there! I am **Boris Leistedt**, I'm a researcher in Imperial College London, working in the fields of astronomy, cosmology, and statistics. Broadly speaking, I test models of the universe using data collected with satellites and telescopes. I care a lot about diversity and equality in sciences and society in general.

I can be reached at **b.leistedt@imperial.ac.uk**

During the current pandemic crisis I work from home and I try to be available for video calls on most days, so do not hesitate to reach out. I only ask that for urgent matters you clearly indicate "urgent" in the subject line in order to get my attention immediately. (In normal times my office is 1003B in the Blackett Buildingm 10th floor, South Kensington campus)
