Hi there! I am **Boris Leistedt**, I'm a researcher in New York University working in the fields of astronomy, cosmology, and statistics. Broadly speaking, I test models of the universe using data collected with satellites and telescopes.

I care a lot about diversity and equality in sciences and society in general.

*Undergraduate/graduate students*: if you are looking for a project feel free to email me.
I have a number of well-defined projects which can lead to impactful, publishable results.
All of them involve a balance of theoretical, methodological, and data analysis work, at the intersection of theoretical physics, astrophysics, and statistics/computer science. Experience in any of those is a plus but not a requirement.
