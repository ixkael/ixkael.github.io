# Information for prospective applicants
<br/>
Reach out if you would like to discuss projects and opportunities. For the projects and positions below, _all scientific backgrounds will be considered._ Candidates from minorities and under-represented backgrounds are particularly encouraged to apply.

Note that most of the projects I offer involve analysis and modeling of astronomical data, with a focus on either cosmology or Galactic astrophysics. Therefore, some experience in scientific programming and data analysis is very strongly recommended (for example in python, which is currently the language of choice in astrophysics). No specific experience is required in astronomy, cosmology, or theoretical physics, or even statistics or machine learning. But some experience or interest in at least some of those fields is strongly recommended.

Please also carefully read <a href="../expectations/"> this page</a> on what to expect when working with me.

## PhD students

Do not be intimidated to reach out to discuss projects and opportunities. You don't need to have a 100% specific idea of what you would like to work on. My colleagues and myself will do our best to guide you through administrative procedures. However, for more efficient discussions please nevertheless do some research on the PhD admission process in the Astrophysics group, as well as possible funding sources (STFC, President's scholarship, etc). I am not describing specific PhD projects here, but it will most likely be in observational cosmology, and involve analysis of real data with sophisticated statistical techniques, and some theoretical modeling. For 2021 the list of available projects in the department <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/astrophysics/students-and-prospective-students/phd-projects/">is available here</a>. I encourage you to contact all the potential supervisors working on topics that interest you. 

## MSc/MSci students

Every year I offer projects that last between 3 and 9 months, depending on the degree, and can be carried out alone or in pairs (but you will be responsible for splitting the work). _All degrees are welcome_. Typically, I expect the projects to attract data-minded students in the following MSc/MSci programs: Physics, Data Science, Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Electrical Engineering, etc. For the requirements, see the message on top of this page. 

### List of possible undergraduate projects (last update Jan 2025):
_The list below describes topics of possible projects for undergraduate research. They are directly connected with my research. If you are interested in a topic, please contact me._

All of my UROP projects have been allocated this year.

Guidance: Please send me a CV, and ask for a time to meet for a chat. When we meet, please be ready to explain why you are interested in the project(s), and what your relevant skills are. This will be an opportunity for you to emphasize your enthusiasm and experience at: 1) reading and summarizing journal papers, 2) coding, debugging, implementing algorithms, manipulating large data sets, visualizing data, 3) explaining and presenting physics and astronomy concepts. I will ask you questions to try and assess these aspects. Our chat is not a formal interview, but it is a wonderful opportunity for you to shine and speak about what excites you in physics research and what you are capable of!

## Postdocs

Our group can support your application for externally-funded fellowship with us. Examples include: Imperial JRF, Royal Society URF, STFC JRF, etc. Simply contact any of the staff members (including myself).
