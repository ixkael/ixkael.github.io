# Information for prospective applicants
<br/>
For the projects and jobs below: _all educational backgrounds will be considered._

However, experience in programming and data analysis will be **required** (no constraints on the specific coding languages or fields of research, however). Knowledge in astronomy, cosmology, or theoretical physics will not be formally required but is obviously an advantage. Interest in statistics, machine learning, or general computational data analysis is strongly recommended too.

## PhD students

Do not hesitate to reach out if you would like to discuss projects and opportunities. However, for more efficient discussions please first research the PhD admission process in the Astrophysics group, as well as possible funding sources (STFC, President's scholarship, etc). I am not describing specific projects here, but it will most likely be in observational cosmology, and involve analysis of real data with sophisticated statistical techniques theoretical modelling.

## MSc/MSci students

Every year I offer projects that last between 3 and 9 months, depending on the degree, and can be carried out alone or in pairs (but you will be responsible for splitting the work). _All degrees are welcome_. Typically, the projects attract data-minded students in the following MSc/MSci programs: Physics, Data Science, Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Electrical Engineering, etc. For the requirements, see the message on top of this page.

### List of possible projects (last update Dec 2020):
- **Measuring the acceleration of the solar system with Gaia data**: repeating the analysis of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.02036.pdf">this paper</a> and conducting a more conventional Bayesian inference version.
- **Improving the Gaia Quasar catalog**
- **Comparison of Bayesian neural network methods**
- **Testing synthetic stellar population models on quasar/AGN spectra**


## Postdocs

Our group can support your application for externally-funded fellowship with us. Examples include: Imperial JRF, Royal Society URF, STFC JRF, etc. Simply contact any of the staff members (including myself).
