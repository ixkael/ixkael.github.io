# Working with me: what to expect?
<br/>
_This page describes the typical expectations I have for working with students. They are of course negotiable, so if you feel like you don't understand or agree with some of it, please do not hesitate to bring it up._

## My part

I commit to doing my best to guide you through your studies (MSc, PhD, etc) and helping you achieving your career goals and your potential. This can include acquiring research skills such as reading and writing papers, analysing data, writing good code, learning data science or theoretical skills, etc. I will also offer you a confidential ear if you ever need one, and will do my best to help you through difficult times, including orienting you to get professional help.

Sometimes I will seem very involved (by sending long follow up emails, etc) or excited. I do that in your interest, in order to provide you with the tools, ideas, and support your need to complete the project at hand. It is _never_ because I want to micro-manage you or police you in any way. My strategy is to give you as much guidance and advice as possible, so that you can make use of what suits you the most. And if I ever inadvertently make you uncomfortable or hurt you in any way, please let me know, and I will apologise and we will adjust our interactions.

## Your part

I expect you to be honest (i.e. no lie or fabricate results, etc), to come prepared to our meetings, and to give me sufficient time when you need something from me. The rest is up to you: you are in charge of your studies and your project. In particular, you can work the way that suits you the most (but I definitely recommend having a good work-life balance, not working on weekends, etc).

You have or will develop your own research style. This includes how you collaborate with people. However, there are some general techniques and tips that apply to a lot of people and that you might consider using too. I personally appreciate many of them, and they help develop fruitful collaborations.

**Get in touch before each meeting**

Send an email recap of the work completed, and what should be discussed during the meeting. It's ok if it is only a few hours before the meeting, since this is mostly to help everyone adjust their expectations and have a think about the work. Obviously, if anything requires any significant thought or action, then it is essential to give more time.

**Come to each meeting prepared**

Arrive with a summary of the work completed (possibly including figures), and a plan of what to discuss, so that your collaborators (including myself) can give you the best feedback and help possible to make progress (time is precious, and meetings are short). Finally, leave with action items. Write notes during the meeting, and clearly collect all suggestions and action items.

**Don't leave items unaddressed**

If you leave with ten action items, then they will all eventually need to be addressed, one way or another. If I (or another collaborator) asks a question or makes a suggestion, it is good practice (for respectful collaboration) to address it explicitly. It will sometimes be totally irrelevant (which you are welcome to demonstrate), but it might also turn up to be a very relevant comment that will help your progress and affect the project.

**Keep a list of actions, open issues, TODOs**

It's ok if some require time or even help from collaborators. But it is critical to be organised and make sure all action items, questions, suggestions, etc, are collected and eventually addressed.

**Embrace feedback**

Sometimes comments can sound like attacks or criticism. But you will find that your supervisors and collaborators only want to 1) help you finish the project/paper 2) give you the best guidance, help, and advice possible, 3) help you achieve your full potential as a scientist.

You will see that having a set of collaborators converge onto a project raises the quality by a large amount.

**Be honest**

It's ok to make mistakes. But it is unacceptable to maliciously hide them and, for example, fabricate results. I will never blame you if something does not work or is not ready. Research takes time and is difficult. Scientific integrity and honesty are of the highest importance. As you will see I make mistakes and I quickly admit them and do my best to correct them.

**Give me sufficient time**

Sometimes you will need something from me (a paper reference, a piece of data or code, a letter of recommendation, etc). Please be mindful that those take time to prepare, so it is critical that you give me enough warning. A short, informal email will suffice. And I do not mind reminders.
