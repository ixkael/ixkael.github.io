I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in the [Center of Cosmology and Particle Physics at New York University](http://www.ccpp.nyu.edu/). I moved to New York in 2015 and was funded by a the [Simons Foundation](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/simons-society-of-fellows/junior-fellows/2015-junior-fellows/) for a year before switching to a [NASA/CXC Einstein Fellowship](http://cxc.harvard.edu/fellows/fellowslist.html) grant. Prior to that I completed my PhD in [University College London](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/star) (UCL) with Prof. Hiranya Peiris. My background is in physics and engineering: in 2011 I received a “Diplome d’Ingénieur” jointly from [University of Mons](https://portail.umons.ac.be/en2/universite/facultes/fpms/pages/default.aspx) (Belgium) and [Supélec](http://www.supelec.fr/) (France), as well as a M.Sc. in Physics from the [University Orsay Paris Sud](http://www.u-psud.fr/en/university/schools/faculty-of-sciences.html). I am originally from [Belgium](http://www.visitbelgium.com/).

[My CV]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/cv_bleistedt_long.pdf) contains a more formal description of my background and research record.

I also contribute to the nice group website [earlyuniverse.org](http://www.earlyuniverse.org/).

I am an **astro-statistician**. I use the latest research in mathematics, data science, and statistics to extract information from astronomical data sets.
I am particularly interested in testing fundamental and high-energy physics using large surveys of stars, galaxies and quasars.
My research interests span **observational cosmology**, **astrophysics**, and **statistics**. In particular, I develop innovative methods to optimally use cosmological dat sets and address topical fundamental questions like the properties of dark matter, dark energy, and neutrinos.

You can look at [my publications on ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/find/all/1/all:+AND+boris+leistedt/0/1/0/all/0/1) if you like to know about my exact research projects.

Some of my talks/presentations are available on [SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/ixkael).
