I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in the [Center of Cosmology and Particle Physics at New York University](http://www.ccpp.nyu.edu/). I moved to New York in 2015 and was funded by the [Simons Foundation](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/simons-society-of-fellows/junior-fellows/2015-junior-fellows/) for a year before switching to a [NASA/CXC Einstein Fellowship](http://cxc.harvard.edu/fellows/fellowslist.html) grant. Prior to that I completed my PhD in [University College London](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/star) (UCL) with Prof. Hiranya Peiris. My background is in physics and engineering: in 2011 I received a “Diplome d’Ingénieur” jointly from [University of Mons](https://portail.umons.ac.be/en2/universite/facultes/fpms/pages/default.aspx) (Belgium) and [Supélec](http://www.supelec.fr/) (France), as well as a M.Sc. in Physics from the [University Orsay Paris Sud](http://www.u-psud.fr/en/university/schools/faculty-of-sciences.html). I am originally from [Belgium](http://www.visitbelgium.com/).

[My CV]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/cv_bleistedt_long.pdf) contains a more formal description of my background and research record.

I also contribute to the nice group website [earlyuniverse.org](http://www.earlyuniverse.org/).

I am an **astro-statistician**: I use the latest techniques in data science and statistics to extract information from astronomical data sets.
My research interests span **observational cosmology** and **astrophysics**: I develop innovative methods to optimally use cosmological data sets and address fundamental questions like measuring the properties of dark matter, dark energy, neutrinos, the structure and dynamics of the Milky Way, etc.

If you'd like to know more about my exact research projects, you can check out [my publications on ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/find/all/1/all:+AND+boris+leistedt/0/1/0/all/0/1).

Some of my talks/presentations are available on [SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/ixkael).

## Specific Research Interests and Selected Publications

### Analysis of Galaxy and Quasar Surveys

- __Data-driven, interpretable photometric redshifts trained on heterogeneous and unrepresentative data.__
B. Leistedt, D. W. Hogg, ApJ, 838, 1, 2017.
_We constructed a non-stationary Gaussian Process in for fitting galaxy photometry as a function of redshift with a latent SED model constraining the fit to be physical. We show how this approach outperforms standard photo-z template fitting._

- __Hierarchical Bayesian inference of galaxy redshift distributions from photometric surveys.__
B. Leistedt, D. J. Mortlock, H. V. Peiris, MNRAS, 460(4): 4258-4267, 2016.
_We described a scheme to correctly infer probabilistic constraints on redshift distributions from photometric redshifts on individual galaxies._

- __Mapping and simulating systematics due to spatially-varying observing conditions in DES SV data.__
B. Leistedt, H. V. Peiris, F. Elsner et al (DES collaboration), ApJS, 226, 2, 2016.
_We presented a fast technique for mapping the potential sources of systematics in the DES data, how those specifically affect the SV data, and how one can simulate and mitigate them._

- __Exploiting the full potential of photometric quasar surveys: Optimal power spectra through blind mitigation of systematics.__
B. Leistedt, H. V. Peiris, MNRAS, 444(1): 2-14, 2014.
_We measured the clustering of SDSS quasars, using optimal statistical estimators and a new technique for mapping and removing spatial systematics from hundreds of templates built from the raw data._

### Fundamental Physics with Cosmolocical Data

- __Constraints on primordial non-Gaussianity from 800,000 photometric quasars.__
B. Leistedt, H. V. Peiris, N. Roth, 2014, PRL, 113, 221301, 2014.
_We used the measurements of the large-scale clustering of SDSS quasars to derive unprecedently strong constraints primordial non-Gaussianity._

- __No new cosmological concordance with massive sterile neutrinos.__
B. Leistedt, H. V. Peiris, L. Verde, PRL, 113, 041301, 2014.
_We argued that the claims of massive neutrinos reconciling cosmological data sets are unfounded and statistically incorrect._

### Analysis of Cosmic Microwave Background Data

- __Wavelet reconstruction of pure E and B modes for CMB polarisation and cosmic shear analyses.__
B. Leistedt, J. D. McEwen, M. Büttner, H. V. Peiris, MNRAS, 466 (3): 3728-3740, 2017.
_We showed how the most advanced techniques for mapping E and B polarization modes can be formulated in wavelet space and yield a new estimator with interesting flexibility and properties._

### The Structure and Dynamics of the Milky Way

- __Hierarchical inference of the color-magnitude diagram and shrinkage of stellar distance uncertainties.__
B. Leistedt, D. W. Hogg, ApJ, in press.
_We built a hierarchical probabilistic model of Gaia DR 1 stars and simultaneously infer the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram and precise distances for all the objects._

- __Red clump stars and Gaia: Calibration of the Standard Candle.__
K. Hawkins, B. Leistedt, J. Bovy, D. W. Hogg, submitted to MNRAS.
_We calibrated the magnitude of red clump stars in various photometric bands using a hierarchical model, including all sources of uncertainties for the first time._
